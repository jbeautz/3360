###Exercise 13A-2
Note that $\forall x\in \mathbb{Z}_6$, $[p(x)]=[x]$.  

Thus, $q(x) = x$ is equivalent on the ring.  

###Exercise 13B-6
(i)
$$[(1 + 2x)][(1 + 2x)] = [1 + 4x + 4x^2] = [1]$$

(ii)  
Given a function $g(x)$.
If $g(x)$ has a unit $g'(x)$, then $g(x)$ is the unit of $g'(x)$. Hence, it must have the form of a unit, $g(x) = 1 + 2h(x)$, for some function $h(x)$ in order to have a unit.  
$$g(x) = [1 + 2h(x)]$$
$$g'(x) = [1 + 2f(x)]$$
$$g(x)g'(x) = [(1 + 2h(x))(1+2f(x))]$$
$$g(x)g'(x) = [1 + 2h(x) + 2f(x) + 4(x)]$$
$$g(x)g'(x) = [1 + 2(h(x)+f(x))]$$
Note that the zero divisors in $\mathbb Z_4$ are $\{0,2\}$ so the resulting coefficients of the polynomial $h(x)+f(x)$ are either 0 or 2.  

Then, $2\times 0 = 0$ and $2\times 2 = 0$. Thus, the terms cancel and $2(h(x)+f(x))=0$.  
$$g(x)g'(x) = 1$$

(iii)
Given $g(x)h(x) = 0$ for nonzero $h(x),g(x)$.

Then $h(x),g(x)$ must be of the form
$$a_0 + a_1 x + ... + a_n x^n$$
Where $a_i \in \{0,2\}$, the zero divisors.  
Form:
$$h(x) = 2f(x)$$

(iv)
Elements which fit into neither form are neither units of zero divisors
$$f(x) = 3x$$
$$f(x) = 2 + 3x$$



***THE END***
