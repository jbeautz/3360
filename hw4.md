###Exercise 7A-15
$\mathbb Z_6$  
$(0,6)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.  
1 is the inverse of 1.  
$(2,6)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.  
$(3,6)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.  
$(4,6)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.
5 is the inverse of 5.  

$\mathbb Z_7$  
$(0,7)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.  
1 is the inverse of 1.  
4 is the inverse of 2.  
5 is the inverse of 3.  
2 is the inverse of 4.  
3 is the inverse of 5.  
6 is the inverse of 6.  

$\mathbb Z_8$  
$(0,8)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.  
1 is the inverse of 1.  
$(2,8)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.  
3 is the inverse of 3.  
$(4,8)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.  
5 is the inverse of 5.  
$(6,8)\neq 1$ so there is no inverse.

###Exercise 7C-23  
$a$ is a zero divisor such that for some $b\in R$, $ab=0$.  
Let $x = by$ for any $y\in R$.  
$$ax = 0$$
$$a(by)=0$$
$(R,\cdot)$ is a monoid so it has associativity.  
$$(ab)y=0$$
$$0y=0$$
Rings also must have the absorption property. Hence,
$$0=0$$

$y$ can be any element in $R$. Therefore, the equation has multiple solutions.  

###Exercise 7C-30  
$$2\times 9=0$$
$$3\times 6=0$$
$$4\times 9=0$$
$$6\times 3=0$$
$$8\times 9=0$$
$$9\times 2=0$$
$$10\times 9=0$$
$$12\times 9=0$$
$$14\times 9=0$$
$$15\times 6=0$$
$$16\times 9=0$$


###Exercise 7C-32  
The prime factorization of $365$ is $5\times73$.  
$[53]$  
$53$ is coprime with $365$ so there is an inverse.  
$$[53\times 62] = [3286]= [1]$$

$[73]$  
$(73,365) = 73$ so there is no inverse.   

$[93]$  
$93$ is coprime with $365$ so there is an inverse.  
$$[93\times 157]=[14601]=[1]$$

$[113]$  
$113$ is coprime with $365$ so there is an inverse.  
$$[113\times 42]=[4746]=[1]$$
